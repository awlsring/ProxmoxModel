# ProxmoxModel

This is an attempt to model the Proxmox API to allow for easier client generation.

The api is very large so this has a long way to go.

To do some manual testing, I'm using a workflow to generate and publish a go client. This can be found [at my proxmox-go repo](https://github.com/awlsring/proxmox-go)
